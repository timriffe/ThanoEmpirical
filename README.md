==============

This repo includes R code and tex files for a study in progress, provisionally titles "Time-to-death patterns in markers of age and dependency" with Pil H. Chung, Jeroen Spijker and John MacInnes. It is likely too early to cite, and we are still just messing around. Still, it is freely available, and can be used with proper attribution:

Data
========
Data are too big to include here, plus it would violate a licensing agreement.
So far all data come from the US HRS, which is available freely to download. I suggest doing a bulk download
using AJ Damico's script, also on [github](https://github.com/ajdamico/usgsd/tree/master/Health%20and%20Retirement%20Study)

Instructions and code to extract and convert data used in this study will be included in this repo when it reaches its final form

Given data in the appropriate input format, the results in this project, numerical and graphical, will be fully reproducible.
