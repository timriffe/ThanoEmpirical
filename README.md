ThanoEmpirical
==============

use US HRS data to get empirical patterns of ageing markers by thanatological age

This repo includes R code and tex files for this study

Data
========
Data are too big to include here, plus it would violate a licensing agreement.
So far all data come from the US HRS, which is available freely to download. I suggest doing a bulk download
using AJ Damico's script, also on [github](https://github.com/ajdamico/usgsd/tree/master/Health%20and%20Retirement%20Study)

Instructions and code to extract and convert data used in this study will be included in this repo when it reaches its final form

Given data in the appropriate input format, the results in this project, numerical and graphical, will be fully reproducible.
