This appendix provides details of how individual variables were numerically
coded for the purpose of calculating surfaces. In many cases the numeric coding
is an arbitrary mapping of a qualitative variable. Results may vary under
different mappings, but we assume that the fundamental findings of this study
will be robust to more thoughtful recodings. Most question items lend themselves
to being spread over a spectrum from good to bad, in which case we give bad the
highest value and good the lowest value. When response universes are bounded, we
scale responses to fit within the range \[0,1\].
