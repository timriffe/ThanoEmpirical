\maketitle

Some individual life transitions are probably best described as a function of
time since birth (chronological age), while others are probably best described as a
function of time until death (thanatological age). These two ways of
measuring age are different because lifespans vary between individuals.
Recently, we presented some results of transforming
data classified by chronological age, like census population counts, into
thanatological age using some simple lifetable
assumptions\footnote{\citep{riffe2014paaposter} A paper on this topic is
currently under review. \citet{brouard1986structure, brouard1989mouvements}
had already done the same thing some 30 years earlier, and we understand that
Scherbov also unwittingly produced the same result over a decade ago. It is
safe to say that most demographers are still unaware of the method, however.}.
This transformation yields the thanatological age structure of the population,
which is interesting enough to justify itself. However, such lifetable-based
transformations are idealized and hypothetical, and in many informal
conversations the question has been raised as to which life history transitions
actually are more precisely described as a function of thanatological age than
in the conventional way. 

Work has been done on this topic in other domains, and
topics examined can be roughly categorized into two types: 1) things that are a
function of apparent or perceived time to death
\citep{carstensen2006influence,gan2004subjective,salm2010subjective,van2010living}, and 2) things that are a function of actual time to death
\citep{miller2001increasing,seshamani2004longitudinal}. The former are mostly
studies on cognitive transitions and economic behaviors, while the latter are
mostly studies on health expenditure (of which there are many). In this paper we
will expand the latter group, focusing on a broad range of questions from the US
Health and Retirement Survey \citep{HRS}.

The present study is exploratory. We have the impression
that such patterns are mostly novel to demographers and as-yet unincorporated in
population-level indicators of ageing or disability. We aim to hash out a
range of domains where it makes sense to think of processes from a
thanatological perspective. Some preliminary results are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:proposalfigs} for three summary indicators and one direct survey
question. ADL measures\footnote{We tested various indices
(\texttt{adl3},\texttt{adl5},\texttt{iadl3},\texttt{iadl5}), and all showed the
same pattern.} and self-reported health show clear patterns of
accelerated increase with the approach to death. Depression increases for both
males and females increase with the approach to death, but assume different
functional forms. Back pain shows no apparent pattern for females, and a
possible spurious decline for males. In the complete proposal we will present a
more rigorous survey and set of comparisons that we hope will enrich discussion
at the conference.

rescaled by $\sigma$. \texttt{adl5} is an index of difficulty with common
activities. \texttt{srh} is self-reported health (higher = worse).
\texttt{back} is back pain (higher = more). \texttt{cesd} is a depression score
(higher = worse).}
